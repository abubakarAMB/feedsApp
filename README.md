This is a simple step-by-step tutorial to get familiar with basic concepts of [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)(used for state management), and [React Native Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html)(used for navigation). This simple App should get you familiar with these Libraries and their use case.
